    <h1>Pubg Mobile</h1>

    <p>
        PUBG Mobile features gameplay similar to that of the original PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Players parachute
        down to a remote island and fight to remain as the last player standing, competing alone or in teams of two or
        four, depending on the game mode selected before the match. Each match lasts about 30 minutes. The game begins
        with the participants flying in a plane over one of many possible maps, also selected before the
        match. As they cross the map, players choose where to parachute down. When the plane finishes its flight, a blue
        border forms around the perimeter of the island, marking the boundary between the safe zone and the exterior
        blue zone. The safe zone shrinks every few minutes, and anyone left in the blue zone will steadily lose health
        as long as they remain there, potentially to the point of death. The rate of health loss increases when the safe
        zone shrinks.When players first reach the island with no supplies or weapons, they must find them around their
        environment or
        loot them from downed players. In general, better weapons and equipment are found in more dangerous parts of the
        map.In addition to the regular shrinking of the safe zone, temporary red zones may randomly appear to be
        barraged with bombs, and from time to time, the plane flies over the battlefield to release a package with
        special equipment, potentially including items that cannot be found elsewhere on the island. All of these
        special events, including the normal safe zone shrinking, are announced to the players before they occur to give
        a fair warning.Additional features unique to the mobile version of PUBG include log-in bonuses, missions and
        micro-goals, crew
        recruiting, map and compass improvements with larger and clear markers near the teammates, and an auto loot
        system, as well as an increased number of bots.
